		<a href = "demo-stanford.html">Click here to experience the Fishbowl</a></div>
		<p>Our virtual fishbowl allows users to interact with virtual fish. If the fish come in contact with
		a shadow, they will swim away. If trapped for too long, the fish will get upset and disappear. </p>
		<p> The virtual fishbowl promotes social interaction in public areas where people are likely to be waiting
		or lounging around in silence.
		Possible venues include dorm lounges, the doctor's office, or an airport waiting room. 
		Without the presence of a shadow, the fishbowl provides passive entertainment by mimicking the behavior of
		a real fish tank.
		However, the fishbowl is not very interesting unless there are shadows in the water, which cause the fish to
		scurry away.
		Multiple people can work together to form interesting shapes with their bodies to make the fish swim in interesting patterns. </p>
		
		<p>As soon as one person begins interacting with the Fishbowl, more people will join and start conversations. 
		Since the Fishbowl is displayed on a large wall, people will have the option of
		standing as far apart from each other as they feel comfortable before moving closer in order to work together. 
		This creates a natural environment where people can meet and get to know each other without experiencing 
		awkward pauses or silences.</p>
		<p> We expect the relaxed, game-like nature of the fishbowl to be especially effective at engaging 
		younger audiences who are eager to play and meet each other, but perhaps a little shy to do so. </p>

			<li> Canvas is a stack of colored paper. Shadow arms can be used to make cuts in the top most visible layer. Use arms to cut out layers and make cool designs</li>

			<li> have a photo of Marilyn Monroe behind a curtain and people can use shadows to draw open curtain</li>
			<li> People walk by and create ripples</li>
			<li> People are outlines. If outline is moving it doesn’t do anything. If person stops, the outline gets radiated out (with sound)</li>
			<li> Volume control: Play sound in background. The more area is covered with shadows, the louder the sound plays.</li>
			<li> Wind chimes, people moving cause ripples, which cause wind chimes to play. Volume based on size/number of ripples</li>
			<li> DJ Shadow can manipulate 2D shadow turntable and manipulate music. (setting:party)</li>

		<h2> Top 3 ideas. </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Silhouette Movie Theater </li>
			<img src="media/movies.jpg" height="600px">
			<p> Purpose: Get people to interact with each other in a social environment. 
				Many people often forgo seeing their friends in favor of staying at home and watching TV. 
				Although movies are fun, watching them alone can get lonely. 
			    Our design forces people to watch TV together. The film will be playing on a large screen, behind a
				virtual black curtain. The content of the film will only be visible in areas with shadows.
		       Large groups of people will contribute to a large shadow surface area, which will reveal more of the film content. 
			   In addition, the sound will also increase in volume with larger shadow surface areas, so people will have to sit close together in order to hear the movie.</p>
			   
			<p>Venues: Since this activity requires a quiet and leisurely environment, we suggest using lounges and quiet entertainment rooms to display it. 
			Retirement home living rooms as well as dorm lounges would be ideal places to offer people casual entertainment while encouraging social interaction. </p>
</p>
			<li> Fish Bowl </li>
			<img src="media/fishtank.jpg" height="600px">
			<p> Purpose: The purpose of the Fishbowl is to g et people to interact with one another while lounging around in waiting areas. 
				The Fishbowl can act as both a relaxing passive source of entertainment, as well as an active medium
				of interaction between strangers. In the absence of shadows, the Fishbowl mimics real fish 
				swimming around in a fish tank. However as soon as shadows enter the water, the fish will scurry away.
				People can work together and interact to create interesting swimming patterns.</p>
			<p>	Venues: Leisurely waiting areas where people are likely to meet strangers but may be too afraid to 
				introduce themselves. Some examples include dorm lounges, airport waiting rooms, doctor's office waiting rooms. </p>
			
			<li> Pixel Art </li>
			<img src="media/colorpixels.jpg" height="600px">
			<p> Purpose: The purpose of Pixel art is to create a beautiful display of colors and teach people about how
			colors combine and together. The screen will begin as a gray box, and each person that walks by will cast a shadow
			on the screen. Each shadow will shift the pixel colors within its perimeter a small amount towards its absolute color.
			For example, if a person had a blue shadow, it would shift all the pixels in its path a little bit closer to blue.
			The history of every person who walks by the display will be recorded as a color imprint on the screen. The more people walk by,
			the more colorful and interesting the display will become. </p>
			<p> Venues: Locations where people are likely to pass by and glance at the display but not stay for too long (We don't
			want people to "draw over" everyone else's color imprints by standing in front of the screen for too long. The idea is
			to observe the history of people walking through by their color imprints.
			 Possible venues include libraries, office building halls, airport terminals, and shopping malls.</p>
