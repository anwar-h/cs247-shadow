	<h2> Most interesting 20 </h2>
	<div class="idea_list">
		<p> We sketched out 20 of our ideas, then narrowed it down to a top 3.  <a href = "https://www.dropbox.com/sh/z9ls3365cavu68v/zO6_AqZFMl">Click here to see our sketches.</a>
		<ul>
		<li> <del>dress people up </del> </li>
		<li> <del> game to use shadow to move around in non-standard dimensions </del> </li>
		<li> <del>shadow ninjas where your shadow amplifies normal motion into ultimate ninja </del> </li>
		<li> gravity well shadows body gets stretched out and dragged away near these particular points </li>
		<li> <del>keep history for a couple minutes then reset 
        collage of people in time walking and interacting
        shadows fade away over time
        can interact with people who have been there before </del></li>
		<li> Proximity: The closer you walk to the screen, the deeper the imprint from your shadow will be. Could use this in sand or water environment. (if we have depth information) </li>
		<li> painting/text covered by a black screen. only shows up where your shadow is </li>
		<li> more people in scene->change color all the way up to 100% </li>
		<li> tug of war, based on the number of people on one side or the other </li>
		<li> map different parts of the screen to different notes. whatever parts of the screen your body is covering are the notes that are playing 
			pick notes that sound ok together 
            closeness determines which notes get played </li>

			<li> game to use shadow to move around in non-standard dimensions </li>
			<li> shadow math: do math operations on shadows. so 1*2 = clone your shadow   </li>
			<li> shadow ninjas where your shadow amplifies normal motion into ultimate ninja </li>
			<li> shadow ping pong game where player bodies are mapped to the screen and you have to move arms so shadow moves corresponding part and hits ball </li>

			<li> whatever you do, your shadow does the opposite (really freaky) </li>
			<li> shadow augments your motions to move around a virtual reality world </li>
			<li> shadow interacts with a projected background image and performs different actions based on the image content (pets a bunny that enters the scene, frolics in a meadow, catches a taxi in a city)  </li>
			<li> what to do with overlapping shadows? 
					make one hold the other up
					cool colors or something whenever there’s an overlap 
					shadow monsters by melding shadows (can create shadow blob) </li>

			<li> gravity well shadows 
				body gets stretched out and dragged away near these particular points </li>
			<li> portal shadows </li>
			<li> have a 3D world and show 2D slices of that world on screen. Shadow can interact with the 2D slice of the world to solve a maze, and the 3D world can be rotated to show a 2D slice in any direction </li>

			<li> comic book style reactions when things interact</li>
			<li> shadows of bond girls walking around, and you interact with them</li>
			<li> people start out on screen as different colors, then when they overlap the colors blend into one until they walk off screen.</li>
			<li> shadow tag to change colors: everyone is black except one person who is red. The red person has to touch other shadows to turn them red as well. Once everyone is the same color, a random shadow turns blue and the game continues.</li>
			<li> Falling shadow, slowly rotating imitating whatever the person is doing</li>
			<li> Canvas is a stack of colored paper. Shadow arms can be used to make cuts in the top most visible layer. Use arms to cut out layers and make cool designs</li>
			<li> Start canvas as grey. Each shadow that moves on screen shifts the grey pixels closer to its own color (red, blue, green, etc.) by some small amount</li>

			<li> give everyone elf ears</li>

			<li> any two shadows get attached by springs. If people walk farther away from each other, the spring stretches. Once they go off screen, the spring and shadows snap together and boing.</li>

			<li> have a photo of Marilyn Monroe behind a curtain and people can use shadows to draw open curtain</li>
			<li> People walk by and create ripples</li>
			<li> People are outlines. If outline is moving it doesn’t do anything. If person stops, the outline gets radiated out (with sound)</li>
			<li> Volume control: Play sound in background. The more area is covered with shadows, the louder the sound plays.</li>
			<li> Wind chimes, people moving cause ripples, which cause wind chimes to play. Volume based on size/number of ripples</li>
			<li> DJ Shadow can manipulate 2D shadow turntable and manipulate music. (setting:party)</li>
			<li> different positions/people are different instrumental/rhythmic tracks that play on top of each other</li>
			<li> Mount camera above and show the paths that people take under it (project the paths downwards and see if that changes the way people walk)</li>
			<li> Display a cute animal on screen that you can interact with on screen (poke it with your shadow and it will run around)</li>
